            As someone who grew up loving to build and create things I would have never known how much I would enjoy creating digitally. I went from being that usual college student that didn’t quite know what they wanted to do to being a disciplined designer pursuing the UX/UI field.<br>  
            
           <br> Designing UI that is user friendly and visually appealing is such a rewarding feeling that increases my passion and desire for the field. There is so much more to learn in the UX/UI world and I am eager to push myself and connect with others in the industry.
